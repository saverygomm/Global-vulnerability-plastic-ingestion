Seabirds are particularly susceptible to ingesting and accumulating plastic, but a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of susceptibility is lacking. We compiled a dataset of behavioural and life-history traits for 351 coastal and pelagic seabird species, and plastic ingestion records for nearly 50,000 birds to deliver a global analysis that identifies the factors influencing observed trends in the frequency of occurrence (FO) of plastic ingestion. Of the 212 species that have been sampled, 67% have ingested plastic but the frequency depends on phylogeny, diet, foraging strategy, age and when data was collected. A higher FO was observed among species that predominantly prey on carrion and non-fish vertebrates, those with surface-oriented foraging methods, and nest-bound birds. We observed no clear temporal trend in the FO of plastic ingestion. We detected no relationship for body mass, study sample size, whether a species was a pelagic specialist or utilized anthropogenic subsidies. Procellariiformes that utilize the infochemical dimethyl sulfide to locate prey have a higher FO of plastic ingestion than those that do not. This indicates support for the olfactory trap hypothesis, whereby seabirds mistakenly ingest bio-fouled plastic. Finally, we identify (1) species that have been well-studied and are susceptible to plastic ingestion, (2) species that have been well-studied and appear to avoid plastic ingestion and (3) species that have been overlooked by plastic ingestion research.

#### There are 4 main scripts. 
    # "1_Phylo analysis input prep.Rmd" : Merge relevant supplemental data files and generate the data2.csv required for the next script.
    # "2_Minimum_adequate_model_FO_req_R.3.0.2_ASReml-R_v3.Rmd : Runs the analysis.
    # "3_Summary Stats and figures.Rmd" : Summarize and plot the results.

#### This project was run in two different versions of R, on a mac OSX platform (x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 (64-bit)).
    # Scripts 1 & 3 are run in R.4.0.4
    # Script 2 is run in R.3.0.2 (to facilitate use of the subscription program ASReml-R v3).
    
    # Note, a subscription to use ASReml-R V3 is needed to run Script 2 https://www.vsni.co.uk/quote/
