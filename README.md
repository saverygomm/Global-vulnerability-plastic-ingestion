Concern about marine plastic pollution has grown considerably in recent years, as the scale and magnitude of the issue has unfolded. The number of marine species known to be affected by plastic pollution has also grown, with yet unknown consequences. Seabirds are particularly susceptible to ingesting and accumulating plastic, attracting both scientific and popular attention. To date, no study has predicted plastic ingestion risk for all seabird species, across the entire world. This is essential to understand the implications of the world wide plastic problem, and to direct research and conservation efforts. Using a 57-year dataset of plastic ingestion records for nearly 50,000 seabirds sampled across all seven continents, we demonstrate that phylogeny, foraging strategy, diet and age of sampled birds are significant predictors of plastic ingestion. We use a phylogenetically informed predictive model to estimate the fraction of seabirds within each species that have ingested plastic for 345 of 355 species, including those that have not been examined. We predict that currently at least some individuals of each seabird species have ingested plastic debris. This includes 16 species where more than 50 birds have been sampled but no plastic has been found. This compares to previous predictions that debris will be found in 99.8% of pelagic seabird species by 2050. Magenta petrel (Pterodroma magentae), black-capped petrel (Pterodroma hasitata), endangered Newellâ€™s shearwater (Puffinus newelli), and Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis) are predicted to be particularly vulnerable. These results highlight why an international agreement on plastic pollution is necessary and will help to target high-risk species for further studies and conservation.

This code reproduces the analysis that generated these results is provided in this repo. **There are two analyses** 

**First** A phylogenetic mixed-effects implemented in ASReml-R v3 and R v3.0.2 that helps to evaluate the traits associated with plastic ingestion across all sampled seabird species by identifying which factors are the minimum adequate model. The input data is a collated empirical dataset of observed Frequency of Occurrence (FO) of plastic ingestion and trait data included records for nearly 50,000 individual birds representing 209 of 355 seabird species.

**Second** To develop phylogenetically informed species-level estimates of FO for all seabird species, the minimum adequate model was then re-run using MCMCglmm, so that best linear unbiased predictor estimates for the random effect of phylogeny could be calculated. This was implemented in R v 3.5.3.

#### There are 4 main scripts. 
    # "2 File_prep_req_R.3.5.3.Rmd" : Tidy input file and generate subset for the **first** analysis.
    # "3 Minimum_adequate_model_FO_req_R.3.0.2_ASReml-R_v3" : Run the **first** analysis to identify minimum adequate model.
    # "4 Predicting_FO_req_R.3.5.3.Rmd" : Run the **second** analysis and generate predictions.
    # "5 Plot_and_report.Rmd" : Plot and report the empirical data and predictions.

#### This project was run in two different versions of R, on a mac OSX platform (x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 (64-bit)).
    # Scripts 2, 4 and 5 are run in R.3.5.3.
    # Script 3 is run in R.3.0.2 (to facilitate use of the subscription program ASReml-R v3).
    
    # Note, a subscription to use ASReml-R V3 is needed to run Script 3 https://www.vsni.co.uk/quote/
