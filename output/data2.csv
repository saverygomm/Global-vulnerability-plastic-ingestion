In British Columbia, euphausiids comprised at least 93% of biomass in spring. On Long I, New York, feeds almost exclusively on small invertebrates, mainly sand-fleas (Amphipoda: Gammaridae). Forages mainly 1_3 m above the water, in flocks of dozens to thousands of birds. Feeds mainly by surface-seizing (51% of attempts) and diving (46%), and by dipping to the surface; occasionally takes swarming insects by aerial hawking. In San Francisco Bay, California, feeds like a phalarope, circling and darting to pick up abundant swarming sand-fleas; also captures them by probing exposed aquatic vegetation. Characteristic feeding pattern is to drift with the surface current, plucking food items from the water, then fly upwind to the front of the flock, land and begin to drift again; birds plunge-diving fly upwind, diving when prey sighted, then veer to the side, fly quickly downwind to the end of the flock, then return upwind over the food source. Concentrates in flocks exceeding 2000 birds over incoming tide. Also feeds at sewage outfalls and power station outflows, particularly at low tide.","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","LC","Non-pelagic Specialist",211,4.517706696,"CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, Second Edition.

Frequent items include small fish, aquatic invertebrates, birds eggs and chicks, trawler discards, rodents and berries. Baltic herring (Clupea harengus) are important where available. Breeders tend to forage at sea to a greater extent than other sympatric gulls. However, an inland colony in the Netherlands, 30 km from the coast, appeared to rely entirely on non-marine food, mainly found in refuse dumps, reaching a relatively high breeding success. Birds nesting at Ebro Delta, Spain, select trawler discards but switched to foraging at rubbish dumps and in olive groves and rice fields during a trawling moratorium. In North Sea a recent increase in sea temperature has seen colonization by swimming crabs (Polybius henslowii); these have become an important food source for Lesser Black-backed Gulls during the breeding season and their presence may be a factor in coincident population increases in regional gull colonies. Little or no cannibalism reported but some individuals predatory, taking many ducklings and other small vertebrates. Wintering birds in Europe (races graellsii and intermedius) are increasingly reliant on garbage scavenged at rubbish dumps, which attract large numbers; ricefields in Iberia and elsewhere also attract wintering birds, which forage for crayfish and spilt rice. Other winterers feed at sea in coastal waters and scavenge at fishing ports. Foraging methods include contact-dipping and surface-plunging; nominate race tends to avoid sites frequented by L. marinus, L. argentatus and L. canus, and forages in deeper water, mainly by plunge-diving.

Recent work in SE Alaska has documented inter-annual variation in prey selection; thus, in 1997 when lipid-rich Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) were abundant, murrelets selected smaller schools near the surface, while in 1998 bigger schools of large herring formed, in deeper water, and further from the surface than in 1997 and 1999, and murrelets were not associated with them, and gadids (predominantly Theragra chalcogramma, but also Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus and saffron cod Microgadus proximus, all low-lipid species) were the most abundant school type in 1999, when murrelets responded by selecting for herring, while school size and depth to schools were less important in choosing food resources.

Dietary studies limited, but principal prey fed to young known to vary geographically: e.g. sandeels, bluethroat argentines (Nansenia candeda), Pacific saury (Cololabris saira) and rockfish (Sebastes) predominated in British Columbia (Triangle I), whereas main foods in nearby Washington (Destruction I) were sandeels, Pacific herring (Clupea harengus) and northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) with lesser quantities of surf smelt (Hypomesus pretiosus) and night smelt (Spirinchus starksi); capelin important at N colonies. Sandeels (Pacific sandlance) are single most important prey delivered to chicks in British Columbia.

Strong preference for sandeels (Ammodytes) and various clupeids in N latitudes. Some evidence that birds breeding sympatrically with both S. hirundo and S. paradisaea show resource partitioning; at one English colony present species differs from the other two species in diet and foraging area, feeding consistently closer inshore. Feeding in shallow water, < 5m deep, is also reported from N American colonies, where sandeels again predominant food item; availability of such feeding habitat may determine location of breeding colonies in N Atlantic. Birds nesting in Seychelles feed young very largely (75_97%) on goatfish (Mullidae); here food intake rate of chicks significantly correlated with local chlorophylla concentration and recent sea-surface temperature, suggesting that food provisioning of tropical Roseate Tern chicks is sensitive to fluctuations in local oceanographic conditions that affect availability of prey fish on a short temporal scale, and that Roseate Terns are suitable sentinel organisms to indicate local changes in environmental conditions. In South Africa, 11 species of fish recorded, mainly ratfish (Gonorhynchus gonorhynchus, mean length 8 cm). In W Africa often snatches sardines (Sardinella) from beach. Often feeds in flocks with other species. Plunge-dives from greater heights and submerges more deeply (up to 50 cm) than S. hirundo. Also feeds by aerial-dipping for small fish driven to surface by predators, and contact-dips for small fish and invertebrates over shoals of bonito (Sarda), tuna (Thunnus) and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix).

Feeds mainly by aerial-dipping or contact-dipping; occasionally by plunge-diving; flying-fish caught in air. Unable to swim and adults are very rarely seen to rest on the water, as their plumage becomes waterlogged. However, juveniles have been reported sitting on the water for extended periods and it is suggested that their dark plumage may be waterproof, perhaps in association with a different feeding strategy. Adults are known to strongly associate with surface-feeding fish, especially tuna such as Katsuwanus pelamis and Thunnus albacares, catching baitfish that are driven near the surface.

Compared to_A. pusilla_and_A. cristatella, each food load constitutes a greater percentage of adult body mass, presumably because the present species typically forages closer to shore and thus its colonies, permitting it to carry larger amounts of food over the shorter distance. Winter food poorly known, but limited information indicates euphausiids and gammarid amphipods are principal prey outside breeding season, with euphausiids (mostly_Thysanoessa inermis) comprising over 90% (wet weight) during Sept_Apr (E Aleutians). Forages near-shore, in summer usually within 10 km of colony, sometimes farther off, most often in flocks concentrated at food-rich locations._Diving_depths unknown, but normally found in waters not exceeding 100 m.","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","LC","Pelagic Specialist",112,3.884347434,"CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, Second Edition.

Breeding birds may forage within the nest pond itself, nearby freshwater ponds, rivers, and inshore marine waters. Adults usually gather food for their young in the nest pond, but often feed themselves elsewhere; however, this pattern is flexible and may vary geographically. Non-breeders forage at sea, often in inshore waters. Migrants and winterers off Pacific coasts of N America frequently form part of mixed-species flocks with cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.), pelicans (Pelecanus), gulls (Larus spp.) and/or auks (Alcidae), that gather at concentrations of baitfish such as sand lance (Ammodytes sp.), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) and/or various smelts (Osmeridae). There are limited data available on diet composition, obtained chiefly from a few analyses of stomach contents. Birds at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, consume large numbers of dead ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) that have been frozen in the ice and are released as the ice melts. Other fish commonly taken at breeding sites include the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). A diversity of invertebrates are also taken at and around breeding sites, including insects: water boatmen (Corixidae), caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera), and dragonfly nymphs (Odonata); small gastropods and crustaceans; tadpole shrimps (Notostraca), fairy shrimps (Anostraca) and water fleas (Cladocera). Non-breeders clearly take a diversity of fish. Species identified in stomachs include medusafish (Icichthys lockingtoni), northern anchovy, shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata) and minute surfperches (Embiotocidae), young salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Market squid (Loligo opalescens) predominated in stomachs of four birds wintering in Monterey Bay.

Recently, stable isotope analysis has revealed that prey type in mauretanicus changes over the course of the breeding season: during pre-incubation period, adult males mostly feed on demersal fish (potentially including Serranus hepatus, Lampanyctus crocodilus, Spicara xexuosa, Phycis blennoides, Symphurus nigrescensand Alloteuthis subulata, 58_5  8_9%), followed by pelagic fish (e.g., Gadiculus argenteus, Micromesistius poutassou, 29_0  10_8%) and then anchovies (Engraulis encrasicolus and Sardina pilchardus, 12_4  6_7%), whereas females during this period mainly take pelagic fish (53_8  17_8%), followed by anchovies and demersal fish in similar proportions (23_6  8_4% and 22_6  13_9%, respectively); during incubation, diet of both sexes mainly anchovies (57_1  11_7% and 66_6  13_6%, respectively) and pelagic fish (42  16_5% and 33_8  15_2%, respectively); during chick-rearing, both sexes fed mainly on anchovy (males = 93_2  10_1%, females = 79_3  11_1%) and secondly pelagic fish (< 15%) while demersal species were not consumed; and it seems that adults fed male and female chicks mainly anchovies (98_3  15_3% and 88_9  14_7%, respectively), and in much lower proportion with pelagic fish (1.7  16.6 and 11.0  15.3%). Movements, e.g. from Mediterranean into Atlantic in midsummer, and changes in ranging behaviour, e.g. winter congregations off NE Spain, appear to be dictated entirely by available food. Feedsmainly by pursuit-plunging and pursuit-diving; information from data loggers suggests that species feeds mainly in morning, early afternoon and around sunset, with most dives being < 10 m (mean 5_6 m), but occasionally reaching 26 m for a maximum duration of 66 seconds (mean 17_6 seconds).

The importance of fishery discards is well illustrated by the example of a major trawl fishery for Loligo squid in the Falklands, in which waste amounts to c. 5% of the reported catch and just over 50% of this waste, mainly Loligo and nototheniid fish, is scavenged by adult albatrosses, with the total quantity scavenged during chick-rearing amounting to 1000_2000 tonnes per year, or 10_15% of the total requirements of the breeding population on Beauchne I during the period when the fishery operates, while a wider study in the same archipelago, covering fisheries of hake (Merluccius spp.), hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), red cod (Salilota australis) and others, found that the species obtains c. 8000 tonnes of food per annum from this source_two-thirds offal and the remainder whole discards_with an energy content equivalent to 4_4% of the estimated total annual requirements of the Falklands melanophris population. Elsewhere, regularly observed attending trawl vessels targeting Argentine red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) off S Argentina. However, more recent research has demonstrated that birds from colonies in comparatively close proximity may show marked differences in their propensity to forage around trawlers, with only a small number of individuals repeatedly following fishing vessels, perhaps indicating that they specialise on fisheries resources. In one study, mean estimated total length and body mass of fish ingested by this species were 246 mm and 164_7 g, respectively, and typically scavenges larger discards than other regular attendees, such as Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus), at trawlers off Argentina. At South Georgia, between 1977 and 1995, chicks fed 13_37% squid (by mass, especially Martialia hyadesi), 5_42% krill (mainly larger and sexually active females) and the remainder in fish (28_72%); considered a krill specialist at South Georgia, with birds dispersing further offshore when krill scarce with result that foraging trips may double in length. Interannual variations can be significant, e.g. at South Georgia, cephalopods were most important dietary component in 1996 (49% by mass) and 1997 (48%), fish in 1998 (32%) and 1999 (40%), and crustaceans in 2000 (63%). Falklands birds take only small quantities of crustacea, being mainly reliant on squid and fish. Captures prey mainly by surface seizing, but sometimes by means of pursuit plunging (from up to 9 m above the surface and reaching up to 4_6 m below surface), surface plunging (mainly for krill or dead fish) or surface diving, aided by the species amphibious optical design, wherein on immersion in water the eyes monocular fields decrease in width such that the binocular fields are abolished; probably forages both day and night, but mainly diurnally. Recent studies at South Georgia reveal that during incubation period, the sexes use different foraging areas and that these are also independent of those used by either sex of T. chrysostoma, which shows similar level of segregation during this period of life cycle. Feeds extensively on large swarms of krill and attends trawlers for discarded fish and squid. Often feeds in company of other Procellariiformes and other seabirds, including penguins (Eudyptes, Pygoscelis), gulls (Larus) and skuas (Catharacta), and off South Georgia (where this species serves as visual cue to presence of food) it appears to initiate and dominate feeding frenzies at large patches of krill; off Chile steals fish from surfacing shags (Phalacrocorax); sometimes follows cetaceans (Balaena, Globicephala, Lissodelphis, Physeter and Orcinus) and feeding association also noted with Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella).","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","LC","Pelagic Specialist",3232,7.246704982,"CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, Second Edition.

High proportion of squid in diet at South Georgia may account for longer nesting period than T. melanophris, which takes mostly krill; five cephalopod species belonging to five families (Gonatidae, Onychoteuthidae, Psychroteuthidae, Ommastrephidae and Cranchiidae) contributed 98% by number and 97% of biomass fed to chicks at South Georgia, where the most important species was the ommastrephid Martialia hyadesi, contributing 68_9_77_4% by number and 72_5_79_3% of total biomass. However, inter-annual variation in diet well-documented, thus at same site, during unusually warm weather in Mar/Apr 2000, fed mainly on krill (Euphausia superba; 77% by mass). Most food taken by surface-seizing, but also uses surface-diving and shallow-plunging to access some items, sometimes reaching up to 6 m (usually less than 1 m). Diving mostly occurs during daylight and this technique can yield up to 30_45% of daily food requirements. Does not usually follow ships (except around Falkland Is) and attends fishing boats less regularly than other species; regularly associates with other tubenoses and cetaceans (e.g. killer whales Orcinus orca), except around New Zealand.

Prey is caught by pursuit-plunging or surface-seizing; dietary analysis suggests that birds opportunistically pick at dead floating squid or directly predate live small juvenile squid that normally inhabit surface waters. Sometimes feeds in association with P. pacificus or boobies (Sula spp.), also Sooty Terns (Onychoprion fuscatus), on small fish driven to surface by tuna, wahoo or cetaceans; the presence of oceanic lightfish (Vinciguerria nimbaria) in the diet indicates that it may specialize in feeding over yellow-fin tuna (Thunnus albacares), like Ardenna pacifica and P. navitatis.

Recent study found that just 27% of prey were taken in patches (distance between two prey < 1 km); rest caught at mean distance of 64 km, with prey in patches smaller than isolated prey and taken mainly at night. Captures prey mainly by surface-seizing, but occasionally makes shallow plunges (up to 1 m below surface), sometimes involving brief pursuit; initial olfactory detection implicated in nearly half (46_8%) of in-flight approaches preceding prey-capture events, accounting for 45_5% of total prey mass captured by such foraging. Commonly catches adult squid at night, when more accessible; those taken nocturnally are smaller (bioluminescent species), whereas those taken during the day were larger (non-bioluminescent species). Often feeds in company of other Procellariiformes, which it dominates by its huge size; sometimes follows cetaceans (e.g. killer whales Orcinus orca, sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus), typically taking their scraps. Habitually follows ships, feeding on offal and galley refuse; exceptionally up to 500 individuals observed following longline vessel near Prince Edward Is. Brown Skuas (Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi) have been observed attempting to kleptoparasitize individuals of the present species.","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","VU","Pelagic Specialist",6300,7.914153475,"CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, Second Edition.

In study of foraging range of 47 individuals from Phillip I during winter non-breeding period, those making single-day trips (72%) foraged 8_14 km from colony, whereas those conducting trips of 2_49 days (28%) foraged either within Port Phillip Bay at up to 62 km from colony or in coastal waters of W Bass Strait at maximum of 147 km; no difference between sexes in trip duration, but total foraging range of males (841 km_) was considerably smaller than that of females (1983 km_) for all months combined, and foraging range in non-breeding period greater than that observed during summer breeding period.

Captures prey by means of pursuit-diving; by day fishes at depths of 20_80 m, and recorded down to 115 m, by night generally not below 20 m. In detailed investigation of foraging ecology of present species and antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) in N Scotia Sea in 2004, krill availability found to be low during summer, increasing in autumn (during breeding season, krill present in 80% of diet samples of fur seal, with _sh remains in 37%); penguin diet comprised seven _sh species (46% of prey by mass), Euphausia superba (33%) and the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii (21%), the fish consisting of the myctophid Electrona antarctica (86% of otoliths), Krefftichthys anderssoni (7%), Lepidonotothen larseni (3%), Protomyctophum choriodon (1_5%), Electrona carlsbergi (1_5%), Parachaenichthys georgianus (0_5%) and Champsocephalus gunnari (0_5%); when needing to return to colony to feed young, both penguins and seals foraged in waters NW of South Georgia (an area with high macrozooplankton biomass), but present species appeared less successful at exploiting krill than were seals; in Mar, when chick-rearing stage finished, the penguins foraged close to Shag Rocks shelf-break (c. 240 km W of South Georgia), probably exploiting the large numbers of _sh in this area during daytime. At Kerguelen, both present species and Pygoscelis papua had maximum foraging ranges almost seven times larger and covered distances up to about twelve times greater during non-breeding period than during breeding. In Dec 2008 study of diving behaviour and diet of females of this species when feeding small chicks on Marion I, twelve foraging trips made by six individuals ranged in duration from 5_6 hours to 80_8 hours (median 22_8 hours), the penguins made a mean of 42_8 dives per hour at sea, and dives averaged 24_6 m in depth and lasted for average of 40_8 seconds (74_3% of dives were to less than 10 m); euphausiids (mainly Thysanoessa vicina) made up 86% (by mass) of diet, fish accounting for 12% (a second peak in dive depths at 55_80 m could have been due to _sh-catching); substantial percentage of shallow night dives (30% of total) suggests that some foraging is done nocturnally. Differences in diving patterns of individuals at Marion I corroborated suggestions of behavioural _exibility reported from other breeding localities, e.g. that at Bird I, in South Georgia, although most other studies had assumed that dives of less than 5 m were commuting dives, whereas that at Marion I indicated that at least some prey caught during shallow dives.","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","VU","Pelagic Specialist",4490,7.575456543,"CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, Second Edition.

At sea, takes mostly bottom-dwelling fish on denuded or vegetated seabeds. In NW Europe takes flatfish, gadoids, viviparous blennies (Zoarces viviparus), sea scorpions (Cottidae), sandeels (Ammodytidae), common eels (Anguilla anguilla), cod (Gadus morhua); on rocky coasts, wrasse (Labridae).

Exploitation of tame, mainly hand-reared, cormorants by fishermen practised for at least 2200 years in China. The birds may have neck-collars to prevent them from swallowing fish, but best birds deliver all their catches to their owners and do not require collars. Fishing with cormorants has declined markedly in recent years and is now principally performed as a tourist attraction. Wing-spreading by this and other cormorant species when at rest on land has been suggested to have range of functions including wing-drying, food-warming and social signalling of foraging success but, where investigated, the duration of this behaviour was correlated only with time spent in the water, supporting the wing-drying hypothesis. Some winter well N of the Arctic Circle, where foraging was studied at Srfjord, an enclosed fjord in N Norway (69 32_N, 19 40_E), where 29_31 individuals roosted and fed daily from late Sept to early Apr in winter 1996/97. At this latitude, the sun remains below the horizon for two months (late Nov_late Jan) but there are c. 4.5 hours of twilight in mid Dec. The birds compensated for shorter daylengths in midwinter by starting to forage later and ending progressively earlier at lower light intensities.

Clearly opportunistic, taking a wide range of fish species as available. Hence dietary composition may differ even between relatively close sites and at different stages of breeding cycle, as well as between seasons. Study of diet of both European subspecies at wintering site inland in France found low partitioning of_prey_species and size between continental_sinensis_and marine_carbo_birds but that larger males take significantly larger prey. At sea, takes mostly bottom-dwelling fish on denuded or vegetated seabeds. In NW Europe takes flatfish, gadoids, viviparous blennies (Zoarces viviparus), sea scorpions (Cottidae), sandeels (Ammodytidae), common eels (Anguilla anguilla), cod (Gadus morhua); on rocky coasts, wrasse (Labridae). On inland lakes takes mainly roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis). On both sides of N Atlantic, sometimes takes schooling fish, e.g. herring, which make seasonal movements to coast to spawn. Birds on W African coast (lucidus)_forage in marine, brackish and fresh waters. Study of regurgitated pellets collected in coastal Mauritania and Senegal found otoliths of 34 fish species belonging to 21 families. There was great inter-site variation in the diet. However, most fish consumed were benthic and bentho-pelagic species 10_20 cm long. In estuaries of South Africa_lucidus_feeds on Cape silverside (Atherina breviceps) and estuarine round herring (Gilchristella aestuaria). In Australia_novaehollandiae_takes large quantities of introduced fish species, e.g._Carassius auratus, perch.

Exploitation of tame, mainly hand-reared, cormorants by fishermen practised for at least 2200 years in China. The birds may have neck-collars to prevent them from swallowing fish, but best birds deliver all their catches to their owners and do not require collars. Fishing with cormorants has declined markedly in recent years and is now principally performed as a tourist attraction. Wing-spreading by this and other cormorant species when at rest on land has been suggested to have range of functions including wing-drying, food-warming and social signalling of foraging success but, where investigated, the duration of this behaviour was correlated only with time spent in the water, supporting the wing-drying hypothesis. Some winter well N of the Arctic Circle, where foraging was studied at Srfjord, an enclosed fjord in N Norway (69 32_N, 19 40_E), where 29_31 individuals roosted and fed daily from late Sept to early Apr in winter 1996/97. At this latitude, the sun remains below the horizon for two months (late Nov_late Jan) but there are c. 4.5 hours of twilight in mid Dec. The birds compensated for shorter daylengths in midwinter by starting to forage later and ending progressively earlier at lower light intensities.
