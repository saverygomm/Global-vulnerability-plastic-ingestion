Feeding.Method.Simple,"The primary feeding method for each species was categorized as ‘aerial pursuit’, ‘bottom-feeding’, ‘diving’, ‘plunging’ (includes pursuit plunging and surface plunging), ‘scavenging’, ‘skimming’, or ‘surface seizing’ (includes dipping and pattering) [31,34]."

susceptibility,"In Data S5, only for well-studied species, we identify species that are susceptible to ingesting plastic regularly (i.e., FO ≥ 0.5 for any age class) and those that are apparently not susceptible to regular plastic ingestion (i.e., FO < 0.1)."
