Successful reproduction usually contingent on availability of lemmings or voles. In high Arctic, reproduction depends mostly on a single species, the collared lemming (Dichrostonyx groenlandicus; L¿ppenthin 1943, Maher 1970b, De Korte and Wattel 1988). In low Arctic, other lemmings and voles are also important (Maher 1974c, Andersson Andersson 1976b, Andersson 1981, Portenko 1989). These rodent populations often vary annually by >2 orders of magnitude, with peaks at intervals of 4-5 yr and a year of intermediate rodent abundance often preceding or following a peak (Maher 1974c, Andersson 1976b, De Korte and Wattel 1988, Stenseth and Ims 1993). Peaks are sometimes synchronized on a regional scale (100-300 km), but not always (Myrberget 1973, Stenseth and Ims 1993). In Arctic, also takes wide variety of juvenile birds, arthropods, and berries (see Diet, below). In areas with no rodents, depends on kleptoparasitism or scavenging (Kampp 1982).

Breeding birds may forage within the nest pond itself, nearby freshwater ponds, rivers, and inshore marine waters. Adults usually gather food for their young in the nest pond, but often feed themselves elsewhere; however, this pattern is flexible and may vary geographically. Non-breeders forage at sea, often in inshore waters. Migrants and winterers off Pacific coasts of N America frequently form part of mixed-species flocks with cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.), pelicans (Pelecanus), gulls (Larus spp.) and/or auks (Alcidae), that gather at concentrations of baitfish such as sand lance (Ammodytes sp.), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) and/or various smelts (Osmeridae). There are limited data available on diet composition, obtained chiefly from a few analyses of stomach contents. Birds at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, consume large numbers of dead ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) that have been frozen in the ice and are released as the ice melts. Other fish commonly taken at breeding sites include the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus).

Non-breeders clearly take a diversity of fish.

The importance of fishery discards is well illustrated by the example of a major trawl fishery for Loligo squid in the Falklands, in which waste amounts to c. 5% of the reported catch and just over 50% of this waste, mainly Loligo and nototheniid fish, is scavenged by adult albatrosses, with the total quantity scavenged during chick-rearing amounting to 1000_2000 tonnes per year, or 10_15% of the total requirements of the breeding population on Beauchne I during the period when the fishery operates, while a wider study in the same archipelago, covering fisheries of hake (Merluccius spp.), hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), red cod (Salilota australis) and others, found that the species obtains c. 8000 tonnes of food per annum from this source_two-thirds offal and the remainder whole discards_with an energy content equivalent to 4_4% of the estimated total annual requirements of the Falklands melanophris population. Elsewhere, regularly observed attending trawl vessels targeting Argentine red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) off S Argentina. However, more recent research has demonstrated that birds from colonies in comparatively close proximity may show marked differences in their propensity to forage around trawlers, with only a small number of individuals repeatedly following fishing vessels, perhaps indicating that they specialise on fisheries resources. In one study, mean estimated total length and body mass of fish ingested by this species were 246 mm and 164_7 g, respectively, and typically scavenges larger discards than other regular attendees, such as Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus), at trawlers off Argentina. At South Georgia, between 1977 and 1995, chicks fed 13_37% squid (by mass, especially Martialia hyadesi), 5_42% krill (mainly larger and sexually active females) and the remainder in fish (28_72%); considered a krill specialist at South Georgia, with birds dispersing further offshore when krill scarce with result that foraging trips may double in length. Interannual variations can be significant, e.g. at South Georgia, cephalopods were most important dietary component in 1996 (49% by mass) and 1997 (48%), fish in 1998 (32%) and 1999 (40%), and crustaceans in 2000 (63%). Falklands birds take only small quantities of crustacea, being mainly reliant on squid and fish. Captures prey mainly by surface seizing, but sometimes by means of pursuit plunging (from up to 9 m above the surface and reaching up to 4_6 m below surface), surface plunging (mainly for krill or dead fish) or surface diving, aided by the species amphibious optical design, wherein on immersion in water the eyes monocular fields decrease in width such that the binocular fields are abolished; probably forages both day and night, but mainly diurnally. Recent studies at South Georgia reveal that during incubation period, the sexes use different foraging areas and that these are also independent of those used by either sex of T. chrysostoma, which shows similar level of segregation during this period of life cycle. Feeds extensively on large swarms of krill and attends trawlers for discarded fish and squid. Often feeds in company of other Procellariiformes and other seabirds, including penguins (Eudyptes, Pygoscelis), gulls (Larus) and skuas (Catharacta), and off South Georgia (where this species serves as visual cue to presence of food) it appears to initiate and dominate feeding frenzies at large patches of krill; off Chile steals fish from surfacing shags (Phalacrocorax); sometimes follows cetaceans (Balaena, Globicephala, Lissodelphis, Physeter and Orcinus) and feeding association also noted with Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella).",1,1,1,1,1,"Yes","LC","Pelagic Specialist",3232,7.246704982,"CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, Second Edition.

Exploitation of tame, mainly hand-reared, cormorants by fishermen practised for at least 2200 years in China. The birds may have neck-collars to prevent them from swallowing fish, but best birds deliver all their catches to their owners and do not require collars. Fishing with cormorants has declined markedly in recent years and is now principally performed as a tourist attraction. Wing-spreading by this and other cormorant species when at rest on land has been suggested to have range of functions including wing-drying, food-warming and social signalling of foraging success but, where investigated, the duration of this behaviour was correlated only with time spent in the water, supporting the wing-drying hypothesis. Some winter well N of the Arctic Circle, where foraging was studied at Srfjord, an enclosed fjord in N Norway (69 32_N, 19 40_E), where 29_31 individuals roosted and fed daily from late Sept to early Apr in winter 1996/97. At this latitude, the sun remains below the horizon for two months (late Nov_late Jan) but there are c. 4.5 hours of twilight in mid Dec. The birds compensated for shorter daylengths in midwinter by starting to forage later and ending progressively earlier at lower light intensities. Fishing constituted only minor part of their time_activity budget, and was one of the most efficient reported in marine birds. Birds spent < 60 minutes a day fishing in midwinter. Although subzero ambient temperatures and blizzards contributed to increased heat loss in midwinter, this potential energy loss did not appear to be compensated by an increase in fish intake. Instead the cormorants seemed to economize energy expenditure by halving time spent at sea, and halving number but doubling mass of each fish taken. Their diet was relatively uniform and dominated by cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens).",1,1,1,0,1,"Yes","LC","Non-pelagic Specialist",2302.414185,6.90756206,"S. T.

Prey caught mainly by spectacular plunge-dives from great heights. Dive depths vary according to circumstances but can be considerable: study off Orkney and Shetland in Jul 1999 found birds dive to mean depth of  19.7 m. Plunge-diving alone does not permit birds to descend deeper than c. 11 m, thus underwater wingbeats are used to extend depth of dives, down to 24 m, and their duration. Also attends trawlers regularly; often forms large concentrations if food plentiful. Observations at largest colony in North Sea (Bass Rock) revealed that 66% of individuals foraged in areas with very low density of conspecifics (> 100 km from colony) and, when one found suitable prey, even distant individuals came to obtain share of food source, but, because of low densities of conspecifics, such opportunities typically were exploited by small flocks, and intraspecific competition was less intense than it would have been nearer colony. Foraging behaviour varies between sea areas. In Bass Rock study, small flocks occurred within inshore multi-species feeding associations, where present species habit of plunge-diving into compact schools of small fish hampered both it and other seabirds, while larger flocks formed in situations where escape response by prey was either absent (e.g. discarded fish behind trawlers) or weakened (e.g. schools herded by cetaceans); association with marine mammals occurred typically offshore (despite abundance of cetaceans in inshore waters). Foraging ranges and prey types of breeders may differ markedly between colonies: N American study found that birds from Funk I, 50 km off Newfoundland, Canada, provisioned young almost entirely on small fish, principally capelin (Mallotus villosus, 89%) but those from Bonaventure I in Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, supplied mainly large pelagic fish (Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus 50%, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus 33%); mean foraging ranges and total distances travelled per foraging trip were 138 and 452 km versus 64 and 196 km at Bonaventure and Funk Is respectively.
