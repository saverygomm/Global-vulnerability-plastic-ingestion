At Kerguelen, both present species and Pygoscelis papua had maximum foraging ranges almost seven times larger and covered distances up to about twelve times greater during non-breeding period than during breeding. In Dec 2008 study of diving behaviour and diet of females of this species when feeding small chicks on Marion I, twelve foraging trips made by six individuals ranged in duration from 5_6 hours to 80_8 hours (median 22_8 hours), the penguins made a mean of 42_8 dives per hour at sea, and dives averaged 24_6 m in depth and lasted for average of 40_8 seconds (74_3% of dives were to less than 10 m); euphausiids (mainly Thysanoessa vicina) made up 86% (by mass) of diet, fish accounting for 12% (a second peak in dive depths at 55_80 m could have been due to _sh-catching); substantial percentage of shallow night dives (30% of total) suggests that some foraging is done nocturnally. Differences in diving patterns of individuals at Marion I corroborated suggestions of behavioural _exibility reported from other breeding localities, e.g. that at Bird I, in South Georgia, although most other studies had assumed that dives of less than 5 m were commuting dives, whereas that at Marion I indicated that at least some prey caught during shallow dives.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,VU,One,"Macaroni Penguins lay 2 eggs, but the first rarely hatches.

Kleptoparasitism and nest robbery less important than once thought. Study at Henderson I, where frigatebirds kleptoparasitise Masked Boobies (Sula dactylatra) particularly, found that whereas some individual frigatebirds may meet c. 40% of their daily energy expenditure in this way, on average kleptoparasitism provided less than 5% of daily energy demands. Kleptoparasitism occurs to different extents in different locations and its frequency is sometimes sex- or age-related. It is employed mainly by males in the Galapagos but by females and juveniles in Hawaii and Aldabra. Target species also differ similarly: on Midway Atoll males chiefly target smaller species such as noddies and terns whereas females, which are larger, target the larger boobies and tropicbirds; chases are more successful when several frigatebirds participate.

Breeding birds may forage within the nest pond itself, nearby freshwater ponds, rivers, and inshore marine waters. Adults usually gather food for their young in the nest pond, but often feed themselves elsewhere; however, this pattern is flexible and may vary geographically. Non-breeders forage at sea, often in inshore waters. Migrants and winterers off Pacific coasts of N America frequently form part of mixed-species flocks with cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.), pelicans (Pelecanus), gulls (Larus spp.) and/or auks (Alcidae), that gather at concentrations of baitfish such as sand lance (Ammodytes sp.), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), northern anchovies (Engraulis mordax) and/or various smelts (Osmeridae). There are limited data available on diet composition, obtained chiefly from a few analyses of stomach contents. Birds at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, consume large numbers of dead ninespine sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius) that have been frozen in the ice and are released as the ice melts. Other fish commonly taken at breeding sites include the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus). A diversity of invertebrates are also taken at and around breeding sites, including insects: water boatmen (Corixidae), caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera), and dragonfly nymphs (Odonata); small gastropods and crustaceans; tadpole shrimps (Notostraca), fairy shrimps (Anostraca) and water fleas (Cladocera). Non-breeders clearly take a diversity of fish. Species identified in stomachs include medusafish (Icichthys lockingtoni), northern anchovy, shiner perch (Cymatogaster aggregata) and minute surfperches (Embiotocidae), young salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Market squid (Loligo opalescens) predominated in stomachs of four birds wintering in Monterey Bay.

Preys on birds, bird eggs and young (including of conspecifics), and rodents and other mammals (e.g. European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, brown rats Rattus norvegicus, moles Talpa europaea), some individuals specializing on these items; flocks sometimes prey on fatigued migrant passerines, particularly those struggling to land into a wind (up to 7% of pellets of gulls on Helgoland, Germany, contained remains of such birds during migration seasons). Kleptoparasitizes other species, especially Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima), Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) and mergansers (Mergus spp.) in Sweden, but also other seabirds that dive for fish, e.g. Great Northern Divers (Gavia immer), elsewhere. Takes insects (including dead individuals), sometimes gorges on berries, or on turnips. Feeding methods are very varied: include walking on mudflats, plunge-diving and surface-dipping; less likely than the smaller gulls to engage in aerial hawking; occasionally foot-paddles on mud, grass or in shallow water. Routinely drops bivalves and arthropods onto hard surfaces to crack them; immatures do so less often, and less successfully. Catches small mammals and birds by stalking and ambushing them. A study in The Netherlands found that most birds fed within c. 55 km of the colony, while in Finland birds  routinely travelled c. 50 km from a colony to feed at a refuse tip.",50,50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,LC,Multi,del Hoyo et al. 1996,,2.5,del Hoyo et al. 1996,13,good,28,,40,,88,50.9,57.15,411.5,NA,80,620,Shelf,200,I,50,NA,NA,200,4054,NA,2000,NA,NA,Full Migrant,1540000,2390000,Decreasing,Suspected,4.5,Schreiber and Burger 2002,32,NA,Schreiber and Burger 2002,22.75395833,87.5,Schreiber and Burger 2002

However, an inland colony in the Netherlands, 30 km from the coast, appeared to rely entirely on non-marine food, mainly found in refuse dumps, reaching a relatively high breeding success. Birds nesting at Ebro Delta, Spain, select trawler discards but switched to foraging at rubbish dumps and in olive groves and rice fields during a trawling moratorium. In North Sea a recent increase in sea temperature has seen colonization by swimming crabs (Polybius henslowii); these have become an important food source for Lesser Black-backed Gulls during the breeding season and their presence may be a factor in coincident population increases in regional gull colonies. Little or no cannibalism reported but some individuals predatory, taking many ducklings and other small vertebrates. Wintering birds in Europe (races graellsii and intermedius) are increasingly reliant on garbage scavenged at rubbish dumps, which attract large numbers; ricefields in Iberia and elsewhere also attract wintering birds, which forage for crayfish and spilt rice. Other winterers feed at sea in coastal waters and scavenge at fishing ports. Foraging methods include contact-dipping and surface-plunging; nominate race tends to avoid sites frequented by L. marinus, L. argentatus and L. canus, and forages in deeper water, mainly by plunge-diving.

Prey caught mainly by spectacular plunge-dives from great heights. Dive depths vary according to circumstances but can be considerable: study off Orkney and Shetland in Jul 1999 found birds dive to mean depth of  19.7 m. Plunge-diving alone does not permit birds to descend deeper than c. 11 m, thus underwater wingbeats are used to extend depth of dives, down to 24 m, and their duration. Also attends trawlers regularly; often forms large concentrations if food plentiful. Observations at largest colony in North Sea (Bass Rock) revealed that 66% of individuals foraged in areas with very low density of conspecifics (> 100 km from colony) and, when one found suitable prey, even distant individuals came to obtain share of food source, but, because of low densities of conspecifics, such opportunities typically were exploited by small flocks, and intraspecific competition was less intense than it would have been nearer colony. Foraging behaviour varies between sea areas. In Bass Rock study, small flocks occurred within inshore multi-species feeding associations, where present speciesê habit of plunge-diving into compact schools of small fish hampered both it and other seabirds, while larger flocks formed in situations where escape response by prey was either absent (e.g. discarded fish behind trawlers) or weakened (e.g. schools herded by cetaceans); association with marine mammals occurred typically offshore (despite abundance of cetaceans in inshore waters). Foraging ranges and prey types of breeders may differ markedly between colonies: N American study found that birds from Funk I, 50 km off Newfoundland, Canada, provisioned young almost entirely on small fish, principally capelin (Mallotus villosus, 89%) but those from Bonaventure I in Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada, supplied mainly large pelagic fish (Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus 50%, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus 33%); mean foraging ranges and total distances travelled per foraging trip were 138 and 452 km versus 64 and 196 km at Bonaventure and Funk Is respectively.

Little plant material consumed, principally on breeding grounds, where diet is dominated by amphipods, caddis fly larvae and crustaceans. Winter diet mainly saltwater molluscs, but in W North America, in early spring, this species and more especially M. perspicillataswitch to feed primarily on Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) spawn, and this also stimulates change in foraging behaviour, increasing dive duration to maximize the quantity of food consumed per dive (in winter, dives typically terminated upon clam capture) and spending less overall time feeding, presumably because of the relative abundance of food. In general, compared to M. perspicillata, winter studies indicate that deglandi takes greater proportion of, and on average larger, bivalves, with less marked seasonal changes in diet composition, loses less body mass over course of season and are reliant on a smaller range of foraging sites. Feeds almost exclusively by diving, propelling themselves using both wings and feet, though occasionally also dabbles on surface, especially at night, when spends mean of just 0_1 minute underwater per 30 minutes compared to > 7 minutes during the day; nocturnal foraging occurs, even in winter, but usually farther from shore and in deeper waters. Study conducted in high-quality foraging area off British Columbia in winter found that individuals of deglandi spent on average c. 13 minutes/hour underwater (22% of daylight hours), but up to c. 5% less time in areas supporting highest densities of prey, although other studies with this taxon have reported values of 30_35% of time. In this population, times underwater were found to differ between adults and first-year birds, with adults spending longer below the surface; this difference is speculated to reflect fact that adults typically weigh more than juveniles and may have to spend more time foraging to sustain their greater body mass, while young do not breed during the subsequent summer and thus have less need of fat stores.

Some evidence of ecological segregation between this species and P. urinatrix in foraging behaviour: at South Georgia and the Kerguelen Is, P. georgicus typically focuses on euphausiids, among other crustacea, these comprising 47_76% and 81% of their prey at the two island groups, respectively, whereas P. urinatrixpredominately took copepods (71%) at South Georgia and amphipods (91%) on the Kerguelens, feeding closer inshore but on average diving deeper than the present species. However, a more recent study at South Georgia, using different technology, found that mean dives of present species achieved 18_1 m and lasted 44_2 seconds  (versus means of 10_5 m and 36_4 seconds for P. urinatrix). Meals fed to chicks at South Georgia were dominated by the euphausiids Thysanoessa (63%) and Euphausia superba (26%), whereas the former genus was absent from the diet of chicks of P. urinatrix at South Georgia, perhaps because they nest earlier there. Breeding birds have restricted foraging ranges: 28_37 km around South Georgia and < 100 km at the Crozet Is.

Exploitation of tame, mainly hand-reared, cormorants by fishermen practised for at least 2200 years in China. The birds may have neck-collars to prevent them from swallowing fish, but best birds deliver all their catches to their owners and do not require collars. Fishing with cormorants has declined markedly in recent years and is now principally performed as a tourist attraction. Wing-spreading by this and other cormorant species when at rest on land has been suggested to have range of functions including wing-drying, food-warming and social signalling of foraging success but, where investigated, the duration of this behaviour was correlated only with time spent in the water, supporting the wing-drying hypothesis. Some winter well N of the Arctic Circle, where foraging was studied at Sèrfjord, an enclosed fjord in N Norway (69ç 32_N, 19ç 40_E), where 29_31 individuals roosted and fed daily from late Sept to early Apr in winter 1996/97. At this latitude, the sun remains below the horizon for two months (late Nov_late Jan) but there are c. 4.5 hours of twilight in mid Dec. The birds compensated for shorter daylengths in midwinter by starting to forage later and ending progressively earlier at lower light intensities. Fishing constituted only minor part of their time_activity budget, and was one of the most efficient reported in marine birds. Birds spent < 60 minutes a day fishing in midwinter. Although subzero ambient temperatures and blizzards contributed to increased heat loss in midwinter, this potential energy loss did not appear to be compensated by an increase in fish intake. Instead the cormorants seemed to economize energy expenditure by halving time spent at sea, and halving number but doubling mass of each fish taken. Their diet was relatively uniform and dominated by cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,LC,Multi,S. T. Garnett in litt. 2008; del Hoyo et al. 1992,,3.5,S.

Other data on regional dietary preferences reveal that those birds breeding on Macquarie I have greater similarities to those on Marion I than to those on the Crozets and South Georgia, due to the greater importance of fish and reduced importance of crustaceans at Macquarie; squid species taken were similar at Macquarie and Heard, with a greater proportion of Histioteuthis eltaninae and Martialia hyadesi at the first-named, compensated by greater consumption of Galiteuthis/Teuthowenia spp. at Heard, while species composition at Macquarie differed less in 1970_1993 than between seasons, either due to real stability in diet or to chance sampling during years of similar diet, prey availability or abundance. Very large squid have been recorded being taken by this species, including a 5_3 kg Kondakovia longimana.

In early spring occasionally feeds on berries; readily accepts fish offal and even bread; also takes caterpillars off grass, or lands to pick up earthworms. In Finland increasingly reliant on chironomids, which are now increasing in number owing to eutrophication. Many studies indicate diverse diet, with fish predominating. In E North America, chicks fed mainly sandeels (Ammodytes) up to 9 cm long and capelin (Mallotus villosus), but at Petit Manan (Maine) main fish fed to chicks were various clupeids. In Iceland and N Europe, chicks fed mainly sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), but also locally crustaceans (Gammarus, Thysanoessa). In Britain, at Farne Is, 95% fish, mainly sandeels and herring (Clupea harengus), while at Coquet I clupeids became more important as season advanced. In Murmansk, adults had more varied diet (only 50% fish) than chicks (88% fish). When preferred prey (Ammodytes) fails, does not readily switch to alternative prey. Very varied foraging methods: hovers and plunge-dives for fish, and hover-dips for fish fry; takes chironomids by flying at height of c. 2 m and dipping to water surface, catching up to 20 prey/minute. Also feeds from perch near water or by surface-dipping. Kleptoparasitism infrequent, but pirates from Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica) on Faeroes; often a victim of piracy from skuas and S. hirundo. Has daily feeding cycles, even in continuous daylight; some feeding occurs at night when prey close to surface. Feeds mainly within 3 km of colony, but up to 20 km and occasionally 50 km from colony. A study at Coquet Island, NE England, has provided evidence of some dietary interspecific segregation between this species and sympatric S. hirundo. Arctic Terns delivered higher percentages of smaller sandeels (Ammodytes marinus) and juvenile fish to chicks than did Common Terns, which delivered comparatively high percentages of larger sprats (Sprattus sprattus).

In South Africa, 11 species of fish recorded, mainly ratfish (Gonorhynchus gonorhynchus, mean length 8 cm). In W Africa often snatches sardines (Sardinella) from beach. Often feeds in flocks with other species. Plunge-dives from greater heights and submerges more deeply (up to 50 cm) than S. hirundo. Also feeds by aerial-dipping for small fish driven to surface by predators, and contact-dips for small fish and invertebrates over shoals of bonito (Sarda), tuna (Thunnus) and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix).

The importance of fishery discards is well illustrated by the example of a major trawl fishery for Loligo squid in the Falklands, in which waste amounts to c. 5% of the reported catch and just over 50% of this waste, mainly Loligo and nototheniid fish, is scavenged by adult albatrosses, with the total quantity scavenged during chick-rearing amounting to 1000_2000 tonnes per year, or 10_15% of the total requirements of the breeding population on Beauchêne I during the period when the fishery operates, while a wider study in the same archipelago, covering fisheries of hake (Merluccius spp.), hoki (Macruronus magellanicus), red cod (Salilota australis) and others, found that the species obtains c. 8000 tonnes of food per annum from this source_two-thirds offal and the remainder whole discards_with an energy content equivalent to 4_4% of the estimated total annual requirements of the Falklands melanophris population. Elsewhere, regularly observed attending trawl vessels targeting Argentine red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) off S Argentina. However, more recent research has demonstrated that birds from colonies in comparatively close proximity may show marked differences in their propensity to forage around trawlers, with only a small number of individuals repeatedly following fishing vessels, perhaps indicating that they specialise on fisheries resources. In one study, mean estimated total length and body mass of fish ingested by this species were 246 mm and 164_7 g, respectively, and typically scavenges larger discards than other regular attendees, such as Kelp Gulls (Larus dominicanus), at trawlers off Argentina. At South Georgia, between 1977 and 1995, chicks fed 13_37% squid (by mass, especially Martialia hyadesi), 5_42% krill (mainly larger and sexually active females) and the remainder in fish (28_72%); considered a krill specialist at South Georgia, with birds dispersing further offshore when krill scarce with result that foraging trips may double in length. Interannual variations can be significant, e.g. at South Georgia, cephalopods were most important dietary component in 1996 (49% by mass) and 1997 (48%), fish in 1998 (32%) and 1999 (40%), and crustaceans in 2000 (63%). Falklands birds take only small quantities of crustacea, being mainly reliant on squid and fish. Captures prey mainly by surface seizing, but sometimes by means of pursuit plunging (from up to 9 m above the surface and reaching up to 4_6 m below surface), surface plunging (mainly for krill or dead fish) or surface diving, aided by the speciesê amphibious optical design, wherein on immersion in water the eyesê monocular fields decrease in width such that the binocular fields are abolished; probably forages both day and night, but mainly diurnally. Recent studies at South Georgia reveal that during incubation period, the sexes use different foraging areas and that these are also independent of those used by either sex of T. chrysostoma, which shows similar level of segregation during this period of life cycle. Feeds extensively on large swarms of krill and attends trawlers for discarded fish and squid. Often feeds in company of other Procellariiformes and other seabirds, including penguins (Eudyptes, Pygoscelis), gulls (Larus) and skuas (Catharacta), and off South Georgia (where this species serves as visual cue to presence of food) it appears to initiate and dominate feeding frenzies at large patches of krill; off Chile steals fish from surfacing shags (Phalacrocorax); sometimes follows cetaceans (Balaena, Globicephala, Lissodelphis, Physeter and Orcinus) and feeding association also noted with Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella).",NA,NA,38,161,0.236,N,N,TRUE,N,"5, 19_21, 23",NT,One,S.
